# PROGRAM 1 HOW TO: ENCODE STRING TO BINARY

1. Input program Findcode into interpreter. 
2. Create a new text file called "text_input.txt" or input predetermined file called "text_input.txt" from M013-group10 GitHub 
3. Input desired string text in text file if you have a created an empty file. (Ex: "abcdefgh")
5. Run program 
6. The desired output will be in a file named "findcode_output.txt" and will be a string of binary values with the count in front (Ex: 4.10001). 

# PROGRAM 2 HOW TO: DECODE BINARY TO STRING 

1. Input program Decode into interpreter. 
2. Use the output file from Findcode program ("findcode_output.txt") 
3. Keep the output in file with the count of the binary. 
4. Run program
5. The desired output will be in a new file named "decode_output.txt" and will be a string of text (Ex: "hello").
